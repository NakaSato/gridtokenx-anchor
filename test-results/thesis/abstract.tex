The transition to renewable energy sources has created a need for efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading platforms that can handle real-time transactions between prosumers in microgrids. This thesis presents GridTokenX, a Solana-based blockchain platform designed for P2P energy trading with Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus.

We evaluate GridTokenX's performance using TPC benchmarks adapted for blockchain technology, following the "blockchainification" methodology established at TPC Technology Conferences. Our comprehensive evaluation includes TPC-C (OLTP), TPC-E (trading), TPC-H (analytics), and Smallbank workloads.

Key findings demonstrate that GridTokenX achieves:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 21,378 tpmC on TPC-C style energy order workloads
  \item 1,741 TPS on Smallbank consensus stress tests
  \item Sub-20ms p99 latency for transaction confirmation
  \item Linear scalability up to 200 concurrent users
\end{itemize}

The measured Trust Premium of 5.67x compared to centralized PostgreSQL represents a favorable trade-off for applications requiring decentralized trust. These results demonstrate that Solana-based blockchain with PoA consensus provides viable performance characteristics for real-time P2P energy trading applications in smart grid environments.
