% Throughput Comparison Figure
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{charts/throughput-comparison.svg}
\caption[Throughput Comparison Across Benchmarks]{
  Throughput comparison across TPC benchmarks showing transactions per second (TPS) for each workload type. GridTokenX achieves 356 TPS on TPC-C (equivalent to 21,378 tpmC), 1,741 TPS on Smallbank, 307 trades/second on TPC-E, and 69 queries/second on TPC-H analytics. The variation reflects the different computational complexity of each transaction type, with read-heavy workloads (TPC-H) achieving lower throughput due to complex aggregations.

% Latency Distribution Figure
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{charts/latency-distribution.svg}
\caption[Latency Distribution by Benchmark]{
  Latency distribution showing p50, p95, and p99 percentiles for each benchmark. OLTP workloads (TPC-C, Smallbank) demonstrate consistently low latency with p99 under 20ms, meeting real-time energy trading requirements. The TPC-H analytical workload shows higher latency (p99 = 147ms) due to complex query processing, but remains acceptable for decision support applications.

% Scalability Curve Figure
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{charts/scalability-curve.svg}
\caption[Scalability Analysis: Concurrent Users vs Performance]{
  Scalability analysis showing throughput and latency as concurrent users increase from 5 to 200. GridTokenX demonstrates linear scaling with throughput maintaining at approximately 545 TPS across all concurrency levels. Latency remains stable at 1.8ms average, indicating efficient handling of concurrent prosumer activity. Efficiency exceeds 100\% at higher concurrency due to improved batching effects.

% Trust Premium Figure
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{charts/trust-premium.svg}
\caption[Trust Premium Comparison with Baseline]{
  Trust Premium comparison showing the performance overhead of blockchain platforms relative to centralized PostgreSQL baseline. GridTokenX achieves a Trust Premium of 5.67x (11.34ms vs 2ms), significantly lower than Hyperledger Fabric (175x) and Ethereum (6,000x). This demonstrates that Solana-based PoA blockchain provides an acceptable trade-off between decentralization and performance for energy trading applications.
