\section{Key Findings}

\subsection{Performance Achievement}

GridTokenX demonstrates viable performance for peer-to-peer energy trading in regional deployments:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{2,076 tpmC} on TPC-C style workloads validates OLTP capability for neighborhood-scale markets
  \item \textbf{229ms p99 latency} in simulation mode (production PoA expected to be lower)
  \item \textbf{99.89\% success rate} demonstrates reliable transaction processing
  \item \textbf{1.81\% MVCC conflict rate} shows efficient concurrency handling
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Trust Premium}

The measured Trust Premium of 58.48x represents the cost of decentralization:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Higher than initially projected due to simulation mode overhead
  \item Still significantly better than Ethereum (6,000x) for energy trading use cases
  \item Acceptable for applications where settlement traditionally takes days
  \item Production PoA cluster expected to achieve lower latencies (sub-50ms)
\end{itemize}

\section{Implications for Energy Trading}

\subsection{Practical Applicability}

The benchmark results suggest GridTokenX is suitable for:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Regional prosumer energy trading (neighborhood scale)
  \item Microgrid settlement with 7x safety margin over projected demand
  \item Automated demand response with sub-second confirmation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scalability Considerations}

With demonstrated throughput of 76.85 TPS, the platform can support:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 10,000+ households at 15-minute meter intervals (requires 11 TPS)
  \item 4,600+ energy trades per minute
  \item Near-instant settlement compared to traditional day-ahead markets
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Results based on simulation mode (not production PoA cluster)
  \item Single-node test validator (not multi-validator consensus)
  \item Apple Silicon platform limitations prevented Docker PoA testing
  \item Latency includes artificial simulation delays
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Deploy multi-validator PoA network on x86\_64 Linux infrastructure
  \item Benchmark with real smart meter data integration
  \item Evaluate cross-chain interoperability with other energy platforms
  \item Scale testing to 10+ warehouse configurations
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

This research demonstrates that Solana-based blockchain with Anchor framework provides viable performance characteristics for peer-to-peer energy trading applications. The GridTokenX platform achieves reliable throughput (2,076 tpmC) with acceptable latency overhead, maintaining the transparency and immutability benefits required for prosumer energy markets.
